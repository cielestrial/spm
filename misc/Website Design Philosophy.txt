I started out with game design, so my approach to UI has always been a minimilist one.
What information is so important it must ALWAYS be displayed?
What information can be poppped in to display when needed?
Avoid clutter, keep it clean and simple, don't bombard with a lot information or choices.

Search:
1 search bar on top.
Searches all followed playlists
If playlist is not in followed Search General button or option

When a track is selected show if they are any playlists you follow which that track is in.
